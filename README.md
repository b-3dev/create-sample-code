# CreateSampleCode - PHP cURL Code Generator

This PHP class provides a convenient way to generate cURL code for making HTTP requests with customizable headers, payloads, and request methods. It's particularly useful for generating cURL code snippets to interact with APIs or other web services in PHP.

## Features
- **Supports multiple HTTP methods**: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `HEAD`, `PATCH`, `OPTIONS`, `CUSTOM`.
- **Flexible Payloads**: Supports various payload types such as `NONE`, `URL-ENCODE`, `JSON`, `XML`, `TEXT`, `BINARY`, `GRAPHQL`, `YAML`, `HTML`.
- **Custom Headers**: Allows custom HTTP headers to be set for the request.
- **Timeout Settings**: Configurable timeouts for both connection and response.
- **cURL Code Generation**: Generates PHP cURL code that can be directly used to send HTTP requests.
